Redux Blog App 
===

#### AKA The Blogatron 


Right... Terrible name I know .. Sorry world. 

This is a blogging web app designed with *React and Redux* Using *for now* the API developed by Steph Grider. Although I plan to develop a backend to be hosted on heroku, using **express** and **Postgresql**.

Cool things I used/discovered (Thanks to S.Grider)
* Redux-promise
* Redux-form - v5-v6 is a nightmare
* Axios
* Styled-components - That one is courtesty of M.Stoiber :smile: .
